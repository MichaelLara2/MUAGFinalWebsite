<body>Here, I have a snippet of a town's theme in the iconic Pokemon Red game. Known as the Lavender Town theme, this song is fueled with spooky and unsettling binuaral beeps.
Due to the eeriness of the song, it's led to rumorous folktales surrounding the game. In certain instances some people believed the fanmade rumour of children commiting suicide due to the beats of the song.
While these rumours were put to rest and proven false, this concept of sound in game shows the power that sound can have over the player.</body>

  <br>Notice at the time stamp of 0:55 until 1:10 the score slows down and begins to sound like a heart rate monitor.</br>
  <br>It then gets loud like footsteps coming toward you, pushing a chaotic atmosphere for the player. </br>
