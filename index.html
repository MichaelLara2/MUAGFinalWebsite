<body>Here, I have a snippet of a town's theme in the iconic Pokemon Red game.
Known as the Lavender Town theme, this song is fueled with spooky and unsettling binuaral beeps.
Due to the eeriness of the song, it's led to rumorous folktales surrounding the game.
In certain instances some people believed the fanmade rumour of children commiting suicide due to the beats of the song.
While these rumours were put to rest and proven false, this concept of sound in game shows the power that sound can have over the player.
What I find fascinating about the impact that the audio has on the human correlates directly to Didier Anzieu's, The Skin Ego.
Reading the work and understadning the impact sound can have on a baby shows how even as we leave young stages we're still impacted by Anzieu's thought on the sound mirror.
When I think of how this sound mirror is disrupted, it's in part because the audio of this track is unfamilar and unknowing.
The audio purposefully, as intended, sends the player into the mindset of uncomfortabilty, panic and anxiety.</body>

<br>Here again, in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon; Explorer's of Time the player is tasked to complete a personailty test to determine what type of pokemon they are and who their partner will be.
One of the things that catches my attention everytime is how the music is parallel to the quiz. The energy of the music is ambient and calm and fully allows the player to focus in on their choices.
Again, I think back to Azieu's mentioning of sound baths and how this audio envelops the player. As if they are having a new life in a new body, feeling all of the emotions and experiences in a new way.
Of course this is the intended feeling the gamer makers wanted the players to feel. After the quiz is taken, you wind up on the shore of a beach unconscious, in the body of a pokemon and no longer a human.</br>

<br>Here is an exmaple of how a theme or soundtrack for a particular charater can enhance and intensify the players expereince.
<br>Notice at the time stamp of 0:55 until 1:10 the score slows down and begins to sound like a heart rate monitor.</br>
<br>Booms are heard, as if footsteps coming toward you, pushing a chaotic atmosphere for the player.</br>
